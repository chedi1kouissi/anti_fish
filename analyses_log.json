    "userSummary": "# \ud83d\udea8 Scam Risk Analysis Report\n\n## Summary\n**Risk Score: 95 - Critical**\n\nThis email is a dangerous phishing scam. It is designed to trick you by pretending to be from PayPal. The goal is to steal your password and gain access to your account.\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d Key Evidence\nHere are the clear signs that this email is a fake:\n\n*   **Fake Sender Address:** The email came from `security@paypal-support-center.com`. This is **not** an official PayPal address. Real emails from PayPal will always end in `@paypal.com`.\n*   **False Urgency:** The subject line \"URGENT\" and threats of your account being restricted are tactics used to make you panic and act quickly without thinking.\n*   **Impersonation:** The sender uses the name \"PayPal Support\" and signs off as the \"PayPal Security Team\" to appear legitimate.\n*   **Suspicious Request:** The email asks you to click a link to \"login\" and \"verify\" your account. This is the primary way scammers steal your credentials.\n\n## \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f What To Do Now\nFollow these steps to protect yourself:\n\n*   **Do Not Click Any Links**\n    The links in this email will take you to a fake website designed to steal your login information. Do not interact with them.\n*   **Delete This Email**\n    Safely remove the email from your inbox to prevent you or anyone else from accidentally opening it later.\n*   **Block the Sender**\n    Block the sender's email address (`security@paypal-support-center.com`) to prevent them from sending you more scam emails.\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f If You Already Clicked\nIf you clicked on a link or entered any information, take these steps immediately:\n\n1.  **Change Your Password:** Go directly to the official PayPal website by typing `paypal.com` into your browser. **Do not use the link from the email.** Change your PayPal password immediately.\n2.  **Update Other Accounts:** If you use the same password for any other online accounts (like your email, banking, or social media), change the passwords on those sites as well.\n3.  **Enable Extra Security:** Turn on Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) in your PayPal account settings. This adds a crucial layer of security that protects you even if someone steals your password.\n4.  **Monitor Your Account:** Keep a close watch on your PayPal account for any transactions you don't recognize. Report any suspicious activity directly to PayPal's official customer support.",

The sender created a fake domain to look legitimate.\n*   **High-Pressure Tactics:** The subject line \"URGENT\" and threats of account restriction are designed to make you panic and act without thinking. Legitimate companies rarely use such an alarming tone.\n*   **Goal is Credential Theft:** The email's primary goal is to get you to click a link to \"login\" and \"verify_identity\". This link would lead to a fake website that captures your username and password.\n*   **Direct Impersonation:** The message uses the \"PayPal Support\" name and branding to appear official, a common tactic for this type of fraud.\n\n## \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f What To Do Now\nFollow these steps to protect yourself:\n\n1.  **Delete this Email Immediately:** Remove the email from your inbox to prevent accidentally clicking on it later.\n2.  **Block the Sender:** Block the email address `security@paypal-support-center.com` to stop them from contacting you again.\n3.  **Do Not Click Any Links or Reply:** Clicking the links will take you to a malicious site. Replying confirms to the scammer that your email address is active, which could lead to more scam attempts.\n4.  **Check Your Account Safely:** If you are concerned about your PayPal account's status, open a new browser window and type **`paypal.com`** directly into the address bar, or use the official PayPal mobile app. Log in there to check for any real notifications.\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f If You Already Clicked or Entered Information\nIf you clicked a link in the email or entered your login details, take these steps immediately:\n\n1.  **Change Your Password:** Go directly to the official PayPal website (**`paypal.com`**) and change your password right away. If you use that same password on other websites, change it there as well.\n2.  **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** This adds a powerful layer of security to your account. It requires a code from your phone in addition to your password to log in.\n3.  **Review Account Activity:** Check your recent transactions and account history for any activity you don't recognize. Report any suspicious activity to the real PayPal support team through their official website.",
